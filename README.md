Programming for Statistical Science - Final Project
-----------

This is the final project for Statistical Computing at Duke University.

The project used 'REST API' to scrape the top 1000 high schools in the US for data analysis and visualization. An interactive map is created using the 'Shiny App' for users to select high schools of interest and customize specific data analysis and visualization.

The result is presented at [here](https://olivenj.shinyapps.io/top_us_school_map/)
