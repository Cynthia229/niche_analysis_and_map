Programming for Statistical Science - Final Project
-----------

This is the final project for Programming for Statistical Science (Fall 2022) at Duke University.

The project used 'REST API' to scrape the top 1000 high schools in the US from the website niche. Data is extracted and cleaned from the scraped links for data analysis and visualization. An interactive map is created using the 'Shiny App' for users to select high schools of interest and customize specific data analysis and visualization.

The interactive map and further information can be found at [top_us_school_map](https://olivenj.shinyapps.io/top_us_school_map/).
